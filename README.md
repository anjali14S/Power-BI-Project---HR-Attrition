# Power-BI-Project---HR-Attrition

This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition within an organization through the creation of an insightful HR Analytics Dashboard in Power BI. The dashboard provides a comprehensive visualization of key factors contributing to employee turnover, helping HR professionals make informed decisions to reduce attrition and improve employee retention strategies.
The dashboard features various interactive elements, including:
Attrition Analysis by Age Group: Visual representation of employee turnover trends segmented by age, highlighting which age groups have the highest rates of attrition.
Attrition by Education Level: A breakdown of attrition based on educational background, allowing for the identification of any patterns in turnover among different qualification levels.
Attrition by Salary Slab: This section explores how salary levels correlate with employee retention, helping to assess whether compensation impacts turnover.
Attrition Count by Job Role: A detailed analysis of employee turnover by different job roles, helping HR to pinpoint which positions may have higher attrition rates.
Attrition by Years at Company: This visualization highlights turnover trends based on the length of time employees have been with the company, offering insights into the effectiveness of retention strategies over time.
HR Analytics Attrition by Travel: A pie chart that illustrates the relationship between employee attrition and travel requirements, helping to identify whether frequent travel is a contributing factor to turnover.
Additionally, the dashboard includes a Question & Answer Board feature, empowering business users to query and receive automated answers about HR-related attrition data, fostering an interactive and user-friendly experience.
